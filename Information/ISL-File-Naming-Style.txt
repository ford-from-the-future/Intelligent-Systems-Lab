File names are composed of three parts;

first is the location, where in the directory it is located.
directory names should be shorthand where possible

second is the actual file name which should be short but clearly state what the file is

last is the file ext

i.e.

a python scanner file in the Turtlebot director would be;

tb_scanner.py
